## Peer Graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repository contains the following files:
-  `README.md`: Explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected
-  `run_analysis.R`: performs the data preparation commands as follows
    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    5. From the data set in step (iv.), creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
-  `CodeBook.md`: Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data
-  `tidy_dataset.txt`: the exported organized, tidy dataset
